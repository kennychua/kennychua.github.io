Another great presentation on how to maximise the value out of your JUnit tests from John Smart of Wakaleo Consulting.

These conventions will certainly go a long way to making the tests more readable

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
nother great presentation on how to maximise the value out of your JUnit tests from John Smart of Wakaleo Consulting.

These conventions will certainly go a long way to making the tests more readableTo add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
  end
  print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
  {% endhighlight %}
