Since the 2008 financial crisis, enacted regulations mandates an entirely different approach to risk analysis. This means that the old systems, which relied on overnight batch risk calculations and predefined queries, can no longer suffice, and a more real time approach to risk calculation, with on-the-fly queries, is needed.

From a solution architecture point of view, Risk Analysis is a compute-intensive and a data-intensive process. Looking at our customersâ€™ systems, we see ever-increasing volumes (number of calculated positions and assets, number of re-calculations, data affinity, etc.) and on the other hand we see an ever-increasing demand to reduce the response time, to conform with the regulations or for competitive edge. That makes it a classic Big Data analytics problem.
