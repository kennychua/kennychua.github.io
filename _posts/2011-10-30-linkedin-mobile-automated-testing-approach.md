A few short months ago, LinkedIn unveiled their latest mobile app which in my opinion is an unparalleled execution of a fantastic hybrid app. I truly believe the hybrid app is the way of the future for mobile development where HTML5+JavaScript is deployed for maximum flexibility & quick turnarounds, but wrapped within native app capabilities (eg infinite scrolling lists for the iPhone). You can read more about it <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/16/linkedin-node/">here</a>.

Anyway, enough about that. The point of this post is the great engineers at LinkedIn are openly discussing their thorough test approach. Have a look below

They also discuss interesting tools like Vows, Robotium and FoneMonkey. I'll be doing some research on this and will post more shortly
