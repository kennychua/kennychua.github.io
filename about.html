<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I’m a polyglot problem solver! I love solving difficult problems across people, process and technology.
</p>
<p>
I've got a diverse technical background where I have roots as a Unix sysadmin, and network admin so I appreciate the fundamentals of how things work. From there I've had hands-on experience building solutions in Java, Perl, C#, building tools and open source Maven plugins leading multiple teams & codebases towards Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery.
I also have hands-on experience with deep understanding of the nuances of designing & building effective RESTful APIs from having created and consumed countless APIs for several Online Banking portals. I've explored several interesting areas beyond typical textbook RESTful API design including HATEOAS, resource linking & expansion, effective caching and building for scalability and graceful failure.

What I don’t know, I love learning about and learning quickly as you can see by my varied technical history. Most recently, I picked up Natural Language Parsing and wrote the current implementation for a bank where you can now perform intelligent searches like "how much did I spend on groceries between Anzac Day and Boxing Day"!
